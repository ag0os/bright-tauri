# Bright - Product Roadmap & Ideas

## Vision
A creation app for writers and creators to build series of books, scripts, or any type of stories with AI assistance, voice dictation, and comprehensive universe building.

## Progress Summary

**Current Phase**: Foundation Complete ‚Üí Frontend Development

**Completion Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Backend (95% Complete)**: Domain models, repository layer, Git integration, most service layer functionality
- ‚úÖ **Design System (100% Complete)**: Full token-first design system with Storybook, all phases complete
- üöß **Frontend (10% Complete)**: Design system ready, awaiting UI implementation
- ‚è≥ **AI Integration (Not Started)**: Awaiting frontend foundation
- ‚è≥ **Voice Dictation (Not Started)**: Awaiting frontend foundation

**Next Up**: Frontend development - Story editor UI, Git integration UI, and core workspace layout (tasks 20-26)

## Implemented ‚úÖ

### Domain Models
- Universe: Project container with genre, tone, worldbuilding notes, themes, status
- Story: With variation system, Git-based versioning fields, and hierarchy support (chapters, child stories)
- Element: Flexible entities (characters, locations, vehicles, custom types) with labeled relationships
- SQLite database with migrations
- TypeScript type generation via ts-rs

### Backend - Repository Layer
- ‚úÖ Universe CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Story CRUD operations (with hierarchy support: list_children, reorder_children, get_with_children)
- ‚úÖ Element CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Element relationship queries (bidirectional)
- ‚úÖ Story variation queries (get all variations in a group)

### Backend - Tauri Commands
- ‚úÖ Universe management commands (create, get, list, update, delete)
- ‚úÖ Story management commands (create, get, list, list variations, update, delete)
- ‚úÖ Story hierarchy commands (list children, reorder children, get with children)
- ‚úÖ Element management commands (create, get, list, list by type, get related, update, delete)
- ‚úÖ Git operation commands (init, commit, branch, diff, merge, history)

### Backend - Git Integration
- ‚úÖ Initialize Git repo for each story/variation group
- ‚úÖ Create branches for variations
- ‚úÖ Commit story content changes (commit_file, commit_all)
- ‚úÖ Diff between variations
- ‚úÖ Merge variations (programmatic merge)
- ‚úÖ Browse version history
- ‚úÖ File naming strategy for story children (001-title.md format)
- ‚úÖ File creation and management in Git repositories
- ‚úÖ File reordering and renaming
- ‚úÖ metadata.json handling for story metadata

### Backend - Service Layer
- ‚úÖ Story hierarchy file management (naming, creation, reordering)
- ‚úÖ Metadata synchronization (metadata.json)
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialization and operations

### Design System (Storybook + React + CSS)
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 - Foundations: Colors (Modern Indigo), Typography (Classic Serif), Icons (Lucide)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2 - Atoms: Buttons (Minimal Squared), Inputs (Filled Background)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3 - Organisms: Cards (Elevated Shadow), Navigation (Minimal Top Bar)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4 - Templates: Dashboard (Stats Grid)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (`docs/design-system.md`)
- ‚úÖ Storybook setup and component stories
- ‚úÖ WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- ‚úÖ Desktop-optimized for writing applications

## Roadmap

- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering (task-22: for chapters/stories)
- [ ] Outline view
- [ ] Notes panel

### Frontend - Git Integration & Story Variations
- [ ] Branch management UI (task-23: create, switch, list branches)
- [ ] Diff viewer component (task-24: visual diff between versions/branches)
- [ ] Merge conflict resolution UI (task-25: interactive conflict resolution)
- [ ] History timeline viewer (task-26: browse Git history with visualization)
- [ ] Create variation UI (branch creation flow)
- [ ] Variation tree visualization (branch graph)
- [ ] Switch between variations (branch switching)
- [ ] Compare variations side-by-side (diff view)

### Frontend - Element Management
- [ ] Element browser/list view
- [ ] Element detail view/editor
- [ ] Custom attribute editor (key-value pairs)
- [ ] Relationship visualization (graph view)
- [ ] Element search and filtering
- [ ] Element templates (for common types)

### Frontend - AI Integration
- [ ] AI chat interface
